## Welcome to AI Ascendant

As a group of commited developers and technologists, we believe that Artificial Intelligence is rapidly increasing in important in all aspects of peoples lives in a way that will transform not just business and commerce but human experience. Having been working with technology for more than 20 years, we've seen the rise of sophisticated web pages and mobile applications and so on transforming how we shop, how we communicate, how we engage with customers and more.
Now is the time where Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence transform things further, with automation, with better targetting, with improved interfaces, with better decision-making and more. 

### Who We Are

A small UK-based team, we've all have more than a decade's experience in areas of IT including project management, web development, mobile development, Artificial Intelligence and mroe.

### How We Can Help

We believe that the Unicorns and other big businesses of the future will be those who embrace the escalating pace of change, who embrace the latest technologies, and who embrace all the thinking required to do so in an honest and ethical manner. Beyond helping make technology decisions, we can advise on some of the pitfalls from this path - Data Protection and Privacy, for example, having caused massive damage to the reputations of the likes of Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. We aim to ensure that our skills cover cyber-security, legal and ethical concerns. Trust has never been so important to businesses, nor so quickly lost.

### Want To Get Involved?

We want to curate thought pieces which express a vision of the future, a plan for businesses to follow. If you think you can help with that, then get in touch. Trust is important - as well as trusting us, we are looking for people we can trust. This site is open source and editable by anyone on our team. We trust those involved in the projec and will be proved wrong if we suddenly start making wild and fanciful declarations on the site. However, if we don't trust our team to work on our systems, why should you trust them to work on yours?
